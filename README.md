### Mucho gusto conocerte 😁

I am still working on my spanish so I am not so great at it yet. Me llamo John (My name is John Ayeni), and I am a Software engineer, mostly into Front end and mobile technologies 📱.

I spend most on my time coding 👨🏽‍💻 and when I am not, I am busy designing ([Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/johnayeni)) 🖌, writing ([DevDesigner](http://devdesigner.xyz/) & [Medium](https://medium.com/@johnayeni)) 📝, or contributing to open source [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/~johnayeni) 🚀.

I am also a big fan of sports, 🏀 and ⚽️ mainly and I am currenctly training myself to be a decent shooting guard in basketball.

In recent times, I have been obsessed with the power cryptocurrencies can provide the world as a whole in terms of financial freedom and crossborder payments and I am fueling that drive as a Front-end engineer at [Busha](https://busha.co).
